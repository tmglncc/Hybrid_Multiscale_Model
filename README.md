# Hybrid multiscale modeling of tumor growth with chemotherapeutic drug dispersion

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by complex phenomena across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Comprehending its growth dynamics is a challenge and may improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms, and suggests more effective therapy protocols. In this context, mathematical and computational modeling may provide insights into tumorigenesis, cancer growth, and response to drug treatments. In this work, we develop a hybrid discrete-continuum model describing the avascular phase of cancer growth and incorporate chemotherapeutic drugs acting in different phases of the cell cycle. The growth phenomenon occurs at three scales: (i) at the tissue scale, partial differential equations model oxygen, drug, and growth factor dispersion; (ii) at the cellular scale, an agent-based model describes transitions among phenotypic states of each tumor cell and mechanical interactions among cells and the microenvironment; (iii) at the molecular level, ordinary differential equations represent signaling pathways that regulate cellular metabolism, cell cycle, and cell proliferation. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework can be instrumental in the development of innovative new treatments for cancer patients.
